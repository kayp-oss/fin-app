/**
 * This file exports all features from the #features directory.
 * It serves as a central point for importing features throughout the application.
 * When adding new features, make sure to export them here for easy access.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * Instead of:
 * import { TelegramMiniAppRegister } from '#features/Button'
 * import { SomeFeatureRegister } from '#features/Input'
 *
 * You can now use:
 * import { TelegramMiniAppRegister, SomeFeatureRegister } from '#features'
